## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

#### After building

The app can be served locally as a static server using:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)â€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```sh
serve -h
```
